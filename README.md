Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principle, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software. It plays a crucial role in technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, inbcluding communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages.
Establishment of software engineering as a disciplne in the 1960's
The advent of structured programming in the 1970's



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design-Creating hugh level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation. Writing code and building the software 
Testing-   Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets qualitu standards

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
ANS : Waterfall It(C S patients}is a sequential approach with distinct phases while flowing dowmwards like a waterfall . Useful for a single developer developing a multi-system application\service. This takes more in
Agile:An iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility predictability  in responding to change useful in cases where a team of developers is working on a single project at the same time with each developer focusing on  their are of expertise

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Roles of a Software developer; responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
QAS: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager:Oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's: important tools for debugging,writing and testing code examples are Visual Studio code and IntelliJ
VCS: Tools for tracking changes to source code and coordiunating work among team members e.g Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements: Require proper planning and proper understanding of system requirements and allow enough time to employ any chnages that might be required this is achieved through effective communication
Tight deadlines -Use of agile methodologies to save time and meet set deadlines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-Tests individual components or modules of software
Integration testing-Testing interactions between different components and subsystems
System testing-Testing the software system as a whole
Acceptance-Testing the software against user requirements to ensure demands are met.
QC measures such as code reviews, automated testing help identify and fix 
defects early in the development process leading to higher quality software products 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is abot crafting questions to get the best possible responses from an AI model. Its importance is that we are able to get clear and concise responses from AI models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Describe changes a a pregnant woman undergoes during pregnancy.
Divided by the trimesters describe the anatomical physiological and hormonal changes a pregnant adult human female is likely to undergo.
The improved prompt is more effective as it clearly categorises the changes and explains the physiology behind eachj change exactly as described by the prompt
